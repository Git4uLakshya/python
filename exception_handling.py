# MAGIC ## Exception and Error Handling
# MAGIC * Until now error messages havenâ€™t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. 
# MAGIC * There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Exceptions
# MAGIC * Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. 
# MAGIC * Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: 
# MAGIC * you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. 
# MAGIC * Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here

# COMMAND ----------

# system level

print('b data type is : ',type(b))

# MAGIC ### Handling Exceptions
# MAGIC * It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.

# MAGIC #### Try Block 
# MAGIC * - here we can write our code - main execution code we can write in try block
# MAGIC #### Exception Block
# MAGIC * - here we can handle whichever excpetion or error thorowing by try block

# MAGIC ### File Handling
# MAGIC ### Reading and Writing Files
# MAGIC * `open()` returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: `open(filename, mode)`.
# MAGIC ### Write to an Existing File
# MAGIC * To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * "a" - Append - will append to the end of the file
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * "w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * "r" - Read - Reading data from existing file

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Open And Reading a File
# MAGIC * To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:

    file.write(x+"\n")

# COMMAND ----------

with open ("abc.txt", "r") as file:
